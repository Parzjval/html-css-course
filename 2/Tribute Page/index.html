            Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico
            on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on
            hunger.

        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>1944</b>
            - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
            pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
            program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
            strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
            for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
            high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
            to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply
            by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
            can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
            crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
            modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
            it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
          contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
          scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
          <cite>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</cite>
